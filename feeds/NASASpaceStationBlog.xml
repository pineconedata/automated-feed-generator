&lt;p&gt;Microgravity science is the main mission aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/unity-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, however on Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; crew focused primarily on life support maintenance. Nevertheless, the orbital septet did find time for cargo operations and biomedical research during a busy day full of hardware swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA Flight Engineers &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; kicked off Wednesday swapping out advanced orbital plumbing gear that took up most of their day. The duo worked in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/tranquility-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tranquility module&lt;/a&gt;, where the orbital outpost’s restroom is located, and disconnected a host of cables and gear to access the station’s catalytic reactor. Dyson did the majority of the preparation work before Dominick assisted her and replaced the old catalytic reactor with a new one. The reactor introduces oxygen in the restroom’s water recovery system and oxidizes its wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominick wrapped up his shift transferring cargo in and out of the Northrop Grumman Cygnus space freighter. Cygnus has been berthed to the Earth-facing port on the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/unity-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Unity module&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2024/02/01/cygnus-installed-on-station-cargo-ops-begin/"&gt;Feb. 1&lt;/a&gt; when it delivered &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/northrop-grumman-sends-nasa-science-cargo-to-international-space-station/" rel="noopener"&gt;8,300 pounds of cargo and science experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, NASA astronauts &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; finalized Dyson’s and Dominick’s life support upgrade work. Epps first installed a hose and a temporary filter in Tranquility to enable startup of the new catalytic reactor. After the startup was completed, the duo cleaned up Tranquility and returned the module’s systems to their normal configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbital outpost’s three cosmonauts had their day full of human research activities while ensuring the ongoing upkeep of systems in the station’s Roscosmos segment. Commander Oleg Kononenko and Flight Engineer Nikolai Chub participated in hearing checks together wearing headphones connected to a computer and responding to a series of audio tones. Kononenko then moved on and refilled an oxygen generator in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/zvezda-service-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Zvezda service module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Chub completed his hearing exam, he joined Flight Engineer Alexander Grebenkin for a fitness evaluation on a treadmill. The duo each took turns jogging on the treadmill while wearing sensors measuring health parameters such as heart rate and breathing rate. Grebenkin earlier conducted cardiac research for a long-running Roscosmos investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

Dyson checks out an Astrobee robotic free-flyer for the Zero Robotics tech demonstration for an educational contest to write robot-controlling software.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four astronauts aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/unity-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; had a full schedule of science activities on Thursday while the three cosmonauts took the day off and spent time relaxing in the microgravity environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; crew services not only life support systems and electronics gear, but also research hardware to ensure the ongoing operation and integrity of a multitude of science experiments. Thursday was no exception as the four on-duty astronauts from NASA worked on a multipurpose science rack, a fluid physics rack, and a CubeSat deployer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; began her morning in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/columbus-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Columbus laboratory module&lt;/a&gt; replacing computer hardware in an &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=598" rel="noopener"&gt;EXPRESS rack&lt;/a&gt;. The rack, one of ten aboard the station, hosts and supports a variety of payloads and experiments. Astronauts as well as scientists on the ground can also monitor and control the rack facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/destiny-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Destiny laboratory module&lt;/a&gt;, Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; also replaced computer gear but inside the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=351" rel="noopener"&gt;Fluids Integrated Rack&lt;/a&gt;. This rack enables research to understand how liquids behave in weightlessness potentially informing the design of fuel tanks and hydraulic systems for spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computers that support the different science hardware can store and downlink the research data. They also enable communications between payloads and other station components including the ability to command and control the space investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/kibo-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Kibo laboratory module&lt;/a&gt;, Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; removed an empty CubeSat deployer from inside Kibo’s airlock. The deployer is routinely packed with CubeSats, grappled by the Japanese robotic arm in the depressurized airlock, and pointed away from the station to release the shoe box-sized satellites into Earth orbit. The CubeSats are developed by international educational and governmental organizations for numerous public research objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominick and Barratt also partnered together and reviewed SpaceX Dragon Endeavour spacecraft procedures to maintain their operational proficiency. Dominick and Barratt are Commander and Pilot, respectively, for the SpaceX Crew-8 mission along with Mission Specialists &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt; of NASA and Alexander Grebenkin of Roscosmos. All four are also Expedition 71 Flight Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epps and Barratt also took turns working in the Waste and Hygiene Compartment, the orbital lab’s bathroom, located in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/tranquility-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tranquility module&lt;/a&gt;. Barratt reinstalled and activated hardware that had been removed earlier in the week for orbital plumbing maintenance. Epps wrapped up the work stowing gear that had been replaced inside Tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbital outpost’s three cosmonauts including Grebenkin, Commander Oleg Kononenko, and Flight Engineer Nikolai Chub relaxed on Thursday taking time out for their regularly scheduled workouts. The trio from Roscosmos will be back on duty Friday for more science, cargo, and lab upkeep duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latest on Boeing’s Crew Flight Test please visit NASA’s &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are targeted to launch aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft to the orbital lab no earlier than 6:16 p.m. EDT on Friday, May 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space physics and life support maintenance topped the schedule at the end of the week for the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; crew as the Starliner astronauts return to Houston. 3D printing and cargo operations also rounded out the operations aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/unity-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coldest place in the universe may be the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=7396" rel="noopener"&gt;Cold Atom Lab&lt;/a&gt; located aboard the orbital outpost’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/destiny-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Destiny laboratory module&lt;/a&gt;. NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; opened up the quantum physics research device Friday morning and inspected its cables and ports as part of broader science hardware replacement work. The ultra-cold laboratory chills atoms to near absolute zero to observe their fundamental characteristics and quantum behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barratt then joined NASA Flight Engineers &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; as they continued life support maintenance in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/tranquility-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tranquility module&lt;/a&gt;. Barratt activated the water processing assembly then reinstalled module components to their normal configuration in Tranquility. Dominick and Dyson spent the day in the module replacing hardware that supports the water recovery system which is part of the orbital outpost’s Waste and Hygiene compartment, or bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt; assisted Dyson at the end of the day finalizing cleanup activities in Tranquility after the advanced orbital plumbing work was complete. Epps began her shift in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/kibo-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Kibo laboratory module&lt;/a&gt; replacing obsolete gas bottles with new types of gas bottles in the Common Gas Supply Equipment rack. The gas supply hardware supplies gases including argon, helium, and carbon dioxide fueling research racks and their experiments inside Kibo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in the orbiting lab’s Roscosmos segment, Commander Oleg Kononenko checked Soyuz communication systems, inspected video equipment, and cleaned vents on broadband hardware. Flight Engineer Nikolai Chub worked on a 3D printing experiment testing the device’s controller and software while printing an object. Chub also stowed trash and obsolete gear inside the &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2023/12/03/progress-docks-to-station-replenishes-crew/"&gt;Progress 86&lt;/a&gt; resupply ship that is due to undock at the end of the month. Flight Engineer Alexander Grebenkin spent his day checking smoke detectors in the &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/07/29/new-module-successfully-docks-to-space-station/"&gt;Nauka science module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ground at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, preparations continue ahead of the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test launch to the microgravity laboratory. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, still in quarantine ahead of the flight test, will return to Houston this weekend as work progresses on a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/05/07/nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test-targets-new-launch-date/"&gt;valve replacement&lt;/a&gt; on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Centaur upper stage. Crew will return to NASA Kennedy prior to the next launch opportunity, which is targeted for no earlier than 6:16 p.m. EDT on Friday, May 17, from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmore and Williams are the first to launch aboard Boeing’s Starliner to the space station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The astronauts will spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory before returning to Earth and making a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successful completion of the mission, NASA will finalize certification of Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station. The Starliner capsule, with a diameter of 15 feet (4.56 meters) and the capability to steer automatically or manually, will carry four astronauts, or a mix of crew and cargo, for NASA missions to low Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full day of orbital upkeep and maintenance kept the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; crew busy on Monday as the septet continues to prepare the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; for the arrival of two astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/tranquility-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tranquility module&lt;/a&gt;, NASA astronaut &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the morning by removing the top and bottom port stalls of the orbital lab’s toilet. Removing the stalls allowed him and his NASA crewmate, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt;, to access the conductivity sensor and pump for repairs. The duo then worked together throughout the day to replace hardware in the station’s bathroom before reinstalling the port stalls and moving onto other work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once orbital plumbing duties wrapped, Dominick moved into the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/cupola/" rel="noopener"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt;, or “window to the world,” to inspect and photograph the conditions of the windows. Dyson assisted NASA astronaut &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; with a Dragon spacesuit check to ensure the suit and its components—such as the ear pieces, garment shirt, helmet visor, boots, and more—are still comfortable and working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barratt also conducted some maintenance on the station’s treadmill and his NASA crewmate, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt;, performed maintenance on the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=973" rel="noopener"&gt;Advanced Resistive Exercise Device&lt;/a&gt;, or ARED. Epps replaced the cable arm ropes on the device’s pulley system, then realigned the tension plates. Later on, she also completed a monthly inspection of the orbital outpost’s defibrillator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/zarya-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Zarya module&lt;/a&gt;, Roscosmos Flight Engineer Alexander Grebenkin spent the entire day replacing different sections of soft air ducts. His crewmate, Nikolai Chub, did have some time to perform some science and ran an experiment that assesses the corrosion of various coatings and materials in microgravity. Station Commander Oleg Kononenko photographed Chub during the experiment, then moved on to assess the condition of surfaces throughout the Roscosmos segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth, preparations continue for NASA’s Boeing Crew Flight Test ahead of the next launch opportunity, which is targeted for no earlier than 6:16 p.m. EDT Friday, May 17. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Houston over the weekend as work progressed on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/05/07/nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test-targets-new-launch-date/"&gt;valve replacement&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Centaur upper stage.&amp;nbsp;For the latest on the mission, please visit NASA’s &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working remaining open tasks in preparation for the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than&amp;nbsp;4:43 p.m. EDT&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 11, the ULA team successfully replaced a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket’s Centaur upper stage. The team also performed re-pressurization and system purges, and tested the new valve, which performed normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starliner teams are working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft’s service module traced to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster. Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA and Boeing are developing spacecraft testing and operational solutions to address the issue. As a part of the testing, Boeing will bring the propulsion system up to flight pressurization just as it does prior to launch, and then allow the helium system to vent naturally to validate existing data and strengthen flight rationale. Mission teams also completed a thorough review of the data from the May 6 launch attempt and are not tracking any other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlas V and Starliner remain in the Vertical Integration Facility at Space Launch Complex-41 on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, still in preflight quarantine, returned to Houston on&amp;nbsp;May 10&amp;nbsp;to spend extra time with their families as prelaunch operations progress. The duo will fly back to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmore and Williams are the first to launch aboard Boeing’s Starliner to the space station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The astronauts will spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory before returning to Earth and making a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successful completion of the mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While science often occupies the crew schedule aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, upkeep of the orbiting complex is just as important to ensure the longevity of microgravity operations. On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; septet spent another full day conducting maintenance on scientific payloads and life support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the day preparing measurement aids for crew quarter inspections that were conducted later in the day. Afterward, Epps charged spacesuit batteries in preparation for a round of spacewalks this summer, then moved into the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/tranquility-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tranquility module&lt;/a&gt; to collect and analyze samples from the Water Processor Assembly, which provides clean, drinkable water for crew members after being recycled from multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Epps prepped the measurement aids, NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; entered the crew quarters to take airflow measurements from the intake ducts. Dominick then continued orbital plumbing work he began yesterday, removing and replacing some hoses, the air filter, and wastewater filter in the station’s toilet. He completed the day by reactivating the bathroom and stowing tools used for the repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though maintenance was at the forefront of today’s microgravity work, Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; did have some time to collect biological samples for ongoing human research. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8413" rel="noopener"&gt;CIPHER&lt;/a&gt;, or the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research, is a suite of total-body experiments that help researchers pinpoint how the human body reacts to long-duration missions in space. Through the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/experiments-to-unlock-how-human-bodies-react-to-long-space-journeys/#hds-sidebar-nav-7" rel="noopener"&gt;collection of biological samples&lt;/a&gt;, scientists can examine changes to cartilage health, inflammation and immune function, kidney health, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his human research activities, Barratt moved into the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/destiny-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Destiny&lt;/a&gt; laboratory module to service the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=7396" rel="noopener"&gt;Cold Atom Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which chills atoms to near absolute zero to observe the fundamental behaviors and quantum characteristics that are difficult or impossible to probe at higher temperatures. Barratt reconnected power and data cables and the filter to the quantum physics device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Dominick’s intake duct measurements in the morning, NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; spent the afternoon in the crew quarters taking additional measurements. She was also joined by cosmonaut and current space station Commander Oleg Kononenko and Flight Engineer Nikolai Chub to complete some on orbit medical training, reviewing procedures that would need to be taken in the event an emergency were to occur on station that requires the use of CPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/zarya-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt; module, Flight Engineer Alexander Grebenkin of Roscosmos assessed lighting conditions throughout the segment, then ran a distillation cycle on the wastewater processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth, NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working remaining open tasks in preparation for the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than&amp;nbsp;4:43 p.m. EDT&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing.

&lt;p&gt;Orbital upkeep was at the forefront of Wednesday’s schedule aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; crew did have some time to conduct human health research and prepare scientific payloads for future operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; spent the morning completing tasks for the CIPHER investigation, collecting blood samples—with assistance from NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt;—and completing a cognition test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8413" rel="noopener"&gt;CIPHER&lt;/a&gt;, or the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research, helps scientists on Earth pinpoint how the human body &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/experiments-to-unlock-how-human-bodies-react-to-long-space-journeys" rel="noopener"&gt;reacts&lt;/a&gt; to long-duration missions in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After human research activities wrapped, Barratt moved into the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/destiny-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Destiny laboratory module&lt;/a&gt; to help NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; install a vacuum jumper to the Major Constituent Analyzer, which checks the quality of the orbital complex’s air. The duo was then joined by Epps and NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; for a midday conference with ground teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epps also spent the day gathering kits for future &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8170" rel="noopener"&gt;Immunity Assay&lt;/a&gt; operations and setting up &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=894" rel="noopener"&gt;Kubik&lt;/a&gt;, an incubator designed to study biological samples in microgravity. In the afternoon, she worked on cargo operations, stowing items in Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyson and Dominick worked on additional orbital plumbing tasks throughout the day, inspecting the toilet after wrapping up maintenance and re-installing the port stalls to the bathroom. The duo also worked inside the station’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/cupola/" rel="noopener"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt;, or “window to the world,” separately to clean the area and its seven windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, Dyson removed and replaced samples from the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=1854" rel="noopener"&gt;Materials Science Lab&lt;/a&gt; and prepared the payload for its next sample run, while Dominick completed some on-orbit medical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/zarya-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt; module, current station Commander Oleg Kononenko ran the 3D printer, while Flight Engineer Alexander Grebenkin completed some computer maintenance. Later on, Grebenkin practiced his piloting techniques during a Pilot-T session, and his Roscosmos crewmate, Nikolai Chub, investigated the behavior of liquid phases exposed to different temperatures and vibrations in microgravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth, NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working remaining open tasks in preparation for the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than&amp;nbsp;4:43 p.m. EDT&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; continued microgravity research on Thursday as the crew spent the day on immunology work and space biology. Two crew members also worked on the orbital upkeep tasks that began earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, one investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8170" rel="noopener"&gt;Immunity Assay&lt;/a&gt;, takes a closer look at immune changes that happen in flight through the processing of biological samples. NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; started the day by collecting samples for Immunity Assay, then NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt; processed and installed the sample tubes into &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=894" rel="noopener"&gt;Kubik&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding how the human body reacts to spaceflight is one step in ensuring spacefarers stay safe and healthy on future long-duration missions in low Earth orbit, to the Moon, and eventually, to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After immunology work wrapped, Epps moved into the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/japanese-experiment-module-kibo/" rel="noopener"&gt;Kibo Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; to assemble &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8841" rel="noopener"&gt;Hicari&lt;/a&gt; sample cartridges for upcoming operations. Hicari, an experiment led by the JAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency), investigates high-quality crystal growth of semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dominick worked with NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; to charge and prep batteries and install data recorders in two spacesuits for a round of upcoming spacewalks this summer. The duo then spent the rest of the afternoon inside the station’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/cupola/" rel="noopener"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt;, detailing and cleaning its seven windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/columbus-laboratory-module/" rel="noopener"&gt;Columbus Laboratory Module&lt;/a&gt;, NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; collected water samples from the water processing tank, then spent the day extracting and sequencing DNA from the samples to identify bacteria and fungi as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=9006" rel="noopener"&gt;GiSMOS&lt;/a&gt; investigation. Characterizing microbial communities in the water system is critical to sustaining the health of crew members and vehicles on future missions aboard the orbiting complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human health research continued in the Roscosmos segment as two cosmonauts—Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub—spent part of their day donning a device that assesses cardiovascular function in microgravity. Chub then reconfigured some of the cameras used by crewmembers in space and practiced his piloting techniques during a Pilot-T session, while his crewmate, Alexander Grebenkin, completed some maintenance in the &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/tag/nauka/"&gt;Nauka&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth, NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working toward the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams are targeting launch no earlier than&amp;nbsp;4:43 p.m. EDT&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, May 21.

&lt;figure id="attachment_347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-347" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-347" src="https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/wp-content/uploads/sites/361/2024/05/NHQ202405050009orig.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="520"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-347" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft aboard is seen on the launch pad illuminated by spotlights at Space Launch Complex 41 on Sunday, May 5, 2024. Photo Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams will take additional time to work through spacecraft closeout processes and flight rationale before proceeding with the launch of the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test. The teams&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;are targeting a launch no earlier than 3:09 p.m. EDT Saturday, May 25, for the flight test&amp;nbsp;carrying&amp;nbsp;NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional time allows teams to further assess a small helium leak in the Boeing Starliner spacecraft’s service module traced to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster. Pressure testing performed on May 15 on the spacecraft’s helium system showed the leak in the flange is stable and would not pose a risk at that level during the flight. The testing also indicated the rest of the thruster system is sealed effectively across the entire service module. Boeing teams are working to develop operational procedures to ensure the system retains sufficient performance capability and appropriate redundancy during the flight. As that work proceeds, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program and the International Space Station Program will take the next few days to review the data and procedures to make a final determination before proceeding to flight countdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ULA Atlas V rocket and Boeing’s Starliner remain in the Vertical Integration Facility at Space Launch Complex-41 on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The NASA, Boeing,&amp;nbsp;and ULA teams remain committed to ensuring a safe Starliner flight test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmore and Williams will remain quarantined in Houston as prelaunch operations progress. They will fly back to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida closer to the new launch date. The duo is the first to launch aboard Starliner to the space station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The astronauts will spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory before returning to Earth and making a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successful completion of the mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/" rel="noopener"&gt;Expedition 71&lt;/a&gt; wrapped up a week of maintenance and health investigations aboard the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/" rel="noopener"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. The septet worked robotics, two human health studies, and finished some cleaning in the cupola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/jeanette-j-epps/" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeanette Epps&lt;/a&gt; started her day in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/japanese-experiment-module-kibo/" rel="noopener"&gt;Japanese Experiment Module&lt;/a&gt; to power on &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=1891" rel="noopener"&gt;Astrobee&lt;/a&gt;, the station’s free-flying robots, to later rehearse the device’s flight and tech operations for an upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8705" rel="noopener"&gt;Kibo Robot Programming Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The challenge is an educational program designed for students to solve various given problems by using the free-flying robots, moving and controlling them remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Epps removed yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8170" rel="noopener"&gt;Immunity Assay&lt;/a&gt; samples from &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=894" rel="noopener"&gt;Kubik&lt;/a&gt;, then incubated them in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=58" rel="noopener"&gt;Human Research Facility’s&lt;/a&gt; centrifuge. The device is designed to separate biological substances from the samples by spinning at high rates in microgravity. Once completed, Epps stowed the samples in &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=56" rel="noopener"&gt;MELFI&lt;/a&gt;, an ultra-cold freezer, to preserve them for future analysis on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/experiments-to-unlock-how-human-bodies-react-to-long-space-journeys/" rel="noopener"&gt;CIPHER&lt;/a&gt; study, NASA Flight Engineer &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/michael-barratt/" rel="noopener"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; set up tomography hardware in the morning and later received an eye examine. In microgravity, body fluids shift toward a crew member’s head, which can cause one of the most visible symptoms of living in space, known as “puffy face.” As fluids shift upward, this can alter the structure and function of the eyes and brain. Astronauts routinely perform eye examines aboard the orbiting complex to help scientist on Earth study these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barratt then moved onto some spacesuit work, manually removing gasses from the Contingency Water Containers, then filling the water tanks in preparation for a round of spacewalks this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronauts often use the station’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/cupola/" rel="noopener"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt; to capture photos of Earth or complete robotics activities, among other tasks. NASA Flight Engineers &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/matthew-dominick/" rel="noopener"&gt;Matthew Dominick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/tracy-caldwell-dyson/" rel="noopener"&gt;Tracy C. Dyson&lt;/a&gt; spent the morning in the “window to the world” to remove and replace some acrylic scratch panes on a few of the windows, work that began earlier in the week, then cleaned the primary pressure panes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Roscosmos segment, Flight Engineer Nikolai Chub and current station Commander Oleg Kononenko spent the day replacing a belt on one of the treadmills. Meanwhile, their crewmate, Alexander Grebenkin, completed some robotic arm simulation training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="background: white;margin: 0in 0in 21.0pt 0in"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: Merriweather;color: #1a1a1a"&gt;NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams will take additional time to work through spacecraft closeout processes and flight rationale before proceeding with the launch of the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test. The teams&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;are targeting a launch no earlier than 3:09 p.m. EDT Saturday, May 25, for the flight test&amp;nbsp;carrying&amp;nbsp;NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="background: white;text-align: start;margin: 0in 0in 21.0pt 0in"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: Merriweather;color: #1a1a1a"&gt;The additional time allows teams to further assess a small helium leak in the Boeing Starliner spacecraft’s service module traced to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster. Pressure testing performed on May 15 on the spacecraft’s helium system showed the leak in the flange is stable and would not pose a risk at that level during the flight. The testing also indicated the rest of the thruster system is sealed effectively across the entire service module. Boeing teams are working to develop operational procedures to ensure the system retains sufficient performance capability and appropriate redundancy during the flight. As that work proceeds, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program and the International Space Station Program will take the next few days to review the data and procedures to make a final determination before proceeding to flight countdown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="background: white;text-align: start;margin: 0in 0in 21.0pt 0in"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: Merriweather;color: #1a1a1a"&gt;The ULA Atlas V rocket and Boeing’s Starliner remain in the Vertical Integration Facility at Space Launch Complex-41 on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The NASA, Boeing,&amp;nbsp;and ULA teams remain committed to ensuring a safe Starliner flight test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="background: white;text-align: start;margin: 0in 0in 21.0pt 0in"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: Merriweather;color: #1a1a1a"&gt;Wilmore and Williams will remain quarantined in Houston as prelaunch operations progress. They will fly back to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida closer to the new launch date. The duo is the first to launch aboard Starliner to the space station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The astronauts will spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory before returning to Earth and making a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="background: white;text-align: start;margin: 0in 0in 21.0pt 0in"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: Merriweather;color: #1a1a1a"&gt;After successful completion of the mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
